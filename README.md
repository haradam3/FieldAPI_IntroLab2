# Field API Intro Lab 2 - Field API Intro

This is a part of introductory materials for BIM 360 Field API discussed here:

https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/field-api-intro-labs-overview/

The labs consist of four modules. Starting from Lab1, it incrementally 
adds code or reuse the code you have written, and implement toward a simple web service application. 

This is the second project that demonstrates how to retrieve a list of projects and a list of issues within a given project, 
and how to create a new issue. (It also includes a chart as a reference, but this portion is not specific to Field 360 API. 
The explanation is in Lab4.)

**How to run the sample project**

* Make sure to have an account for BIM 360 Field. If you don't have it, you can get a trial account from here: 
http://www.autodeskbim360.com/bim360-field-trial

* No key and secret are needed to use Field API. 

The project is written in C#, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, .NET 4.5.2.

Dependency: RestSharp 106.2.0 (NuGet will automatically download a package when you build.) 

Disclaimer: Minimum error checking for simplicity and readability to focus on learning BIM 360 Field API. 

For detailed explanation, please take a look at this post:

(Note: The project here is slightly updated. But the basic usage of Field API itself is the same.)
